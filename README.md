Welcome to my pack of Quickfort Blueprints for Dwarf Fortress.

To install these Blueprints, copy the Architect folder into the following directory:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Dwarf Fortress\dfhack-config\blueprints

Introduction:
I have little experience with DFHack or Quickfort, but I will use Quickfort in the future to test and ensure that the content being made is good enough for the public. I am still learning how to use Quickfort's functions, so I will do my best to update the blueprints as I recieve feedback on which ones to "upgrade" so to speak. 

The biggest issue of this pack is naming and describing what to do with the blueprints. Throughout each Blueprint, there will be a name that will describe what the purpose of the Blueprint is for, along with the Folder that it's in to describe the general category that it's in.

This blueprint pack is still a *work in progress*, as you may find that certain colors are not consistent, and some of the content that i want to push out will be done later on I guess. I just want to make sure the pack is as clean and complete as possible.

To start, i'll describe all of the Terminology that I used in naming each Blueprint to get a better idea of what to do with them:
